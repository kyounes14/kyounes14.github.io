I’m a PhD student at Stanford working with [Matthias Ihme](http://web.stanford.edu/group/ihmegroup/cgi-bin/MatthiasIhme/people/matthias-ihme/). My research focuses on integrating ML approaches to X-ray scattering experiments, with the main goal being an improved understanding of the underlying chemical physics. 

Prior to Stanford, I completed my master’s and bachelor’s degrees at the University of Waterloo, Ontario, Canada, where I was supervised by [Jean-Pierre Hickey](https://uwaterloo.ca/mechanical-mechatronics-engineering/profile/j6hickey). In broad terms, my research interests lie at the intersection of applied mathematics and fluid mechanics. More specifically, I am interested in reduced-order modeling of complex fluid dynamics systems. Past research projects have included turbulence wall modeling (master’s work), fluidic shock-vectoring, indirect noise, and passive control of turbulence. A more detailed description of each of these can be found here.

When I am not conducting research, I am usually either reading or writing about various topics. In general, I am a firm believer in the value of scientific communication and education outreach, and I think it is important to present one’s research for the lay audience. For that, I have compiled in my blog a list of topics that have fascinated me over the years. These range from subjects within my field to others. If you have any questions or comments, or would like to collaborate with me, feel free to drop me a line.
