I’m a PhD student at Stanford and part of Prof. Matthias Ihme’s research group. My research focuses on supercritical fluids and data assimilation. Prior to Stanford, I completed my master’s and bachelor’s degrees at the University of Waterloo, Ontario, Canada, where I was supervised by Prof. Jean-Pierre Hickey. In broad terms, my research interests lie at the intersection of applied mathematics and fluid mechanics. More specifically, I am interested in reduced-order modeling of complex fluid dynamics systems. Past research projects have included turbulence wall modeling (master’s work), fluidic shock-vectoring, indirect noise, and passive control of turbulence.
